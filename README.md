# Aviator by Lucky Star: The Ultimate Guide for Indian Players

## What is Aviator by Lucky Star?

Aviator is a thrilling online crash game offered by Lucky Star Casino.
It\'s a fast-paced game where players bet on the duration of a plane\'s
flight. The goal is to cash out before the plane crashes to win a
multiplier of your bet. The longer the plane flies, the higher the
multiplier. However, if you cash out too late, the plane will crash, and
you\'ll lose your bet.
